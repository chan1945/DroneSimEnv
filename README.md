# Docker container env for Drone simulation (PX4 SITL)

## Prerequisites (must be installed before running)
- Docker
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit — required to use the GPU inside Docker containers
  https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/

## Demo Video

[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/C68um9y9g6o/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C68um9y9g6o)

## How to use
### clone the repository
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/chan1945/DroneSimEnv.git
```
### Build images and run containers

Ubuntu and WSL2 use the same commands. `sim_run.sh` detects WSL2 by itself and
uses its graphics settings automatically.

```bash
cd DroneSimEnv/Docker
./sim_build.sh
./sim_run.sh
```

The build script creates the Docker images. The run script then starts the three
containers in the background and opens terminal windows for:
- `companion`
- `drone_sim`
- `ground`

Keep the original terminal window open while using the new shell windows. Press
any key in the original window to stop and remove all three containers. Pressing
`Ctrl+C` also removes them.

## Included Software
```
drone_sim
├─PX4 v1.16.1
├─Gazebo Harmonic

ground
├─QGroundControl

companion
├─ROS2 Humble
├─Micro XRCE DDS Agent v2.4.3
```

## !!warning!!
DroneSimEnv uses the nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.6.3-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04 image as its base image to ensure that the implemented code remains compatible with the actual hardware platform, the Jetson Orin Nano, which supports CUDA 12.6.
